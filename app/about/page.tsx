        <p>We’re Mr. Bưởi, a clothing brand for pet lovers.</p>
        <p>
          Our inspiration comes from our own cat, Mr. Bưởi, who once faced a broken leg and the long road to recovery.
          Caring for him was tough, not just emotionally but financially too. We know firsthand what it’s like to love
          your pet deeply while struggling to cover the costs of keeping them healthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why we started Mr. Bưởi. Our designs, created in a unique and playful art style with plenty of humor,
          celebrate the bond between pets and their humans. Each piece is a reminder of the joy, resilience, and
          laughter that animals bring into our lives.
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p>But our mission doesn’t stop at design. With every purchase, we give back to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Animal shelters that provide second chances</li>
            <li>Low-income veterinary clinics that keep pets healthy</li>
            <li>Pet lovers in need who are facing unexpected medical costs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          For us, Mr. Bưởi isn’t just our cat. He’s a symbol of love, resilience, and the belief that every pet
          deserves care no matter the circumstances.
